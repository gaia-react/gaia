# Changelog

All notable changes to GAIA React are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

- **Major** — breaking changes to skill/command API, Node/React/React Router major bumps, removed or renamed `.claude/` paths.
- **Minor** — new skills, commands, or wiki concept pages; opt-in features.
- **Patch** — bugfixes, docs, and in-range dependency bumps.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- `/init` interceptor now reliably redirects to `/gaia-init`. The previous implementation used `UserPromptSubmit` + `exit 2`, which blocked the turn entirely so the model never ran. Switched to `UserPromptExpansion` (matcher: `init`) with `additionalContext` only — the model receives `/init`'s expansion plus a system-reminder override telling it to invoke `/gaia-init` via the Skill tool. The user-visible "blocked by hook" banner is gone.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-30

### Initial release

GAIA v1.0.0 is the inaugural public release of the GAIA React workflow — a Claude-native foundation that ships skills, commands, hooks, a wiki, and a curated React Router 7 app skeleton designed for agentic development from day one.

#### Highlights

- **Claude integration surface.** `.claude/` ships with rules, settings, hooks, an agent skills bundle (`typescript`, `react-code`, `tailwind`, `tdd`, `skeleton-loaders`, `playwright-cli`, `eslint-fixes`, `update-deps`, scaffolders), and an agent commands catalog. `CLAUDE.md` is curated for context economy.
- **GAIA workflows.** `/gaia plan`, `/gaia handoff`, `/gaia pickup`, `/gaia audit` cover task orchestration, session continuity, and knowledge-store hygiene. `/gaia-init` bootstraps new projects from the template.
- **Wiki vault.** Architecture overview, decisions (Quality Gate, pnpm, Dark Mode Modernization, etc.), modules (Routing, Styling, i18n, Form Components), concepts (Agentic Design, API Service Pattern, Component Testing, Task Orchestration), and a hot/log pair for session continuity.
- **App stack.** React Router 7, React 19, Tailwind v4, ESLint 9, Vite 8, Vitest 4, TypeScript 6, pnpm 10, MSW 2 + `@msw/data` 1.x.
- **Form system.** Conform + Zod for type-safe forms with reusable field components.
- **i18n.** `remix-i18next` middleware, English + Japanese language scaffolding, `LanguageSelect` component, Storybook locale switcher.
- **Dark mode.** Cookie-as-truth + `@epic-web/client-hints` + optimistic `useFetchers()` UI.
- **Quality gate.** Mandatory pre-commit pipeline: simplify, localization check, typecheck, lint, unit tests, E2E tests, dev smoke test, build. Zero warnings tolerated.
- **Release tooling.** Tag-triggered `release.yml` builds a scrubbed tarball; `create-gaia` bootstrapper consumes it via `npx create-gaia my-app`.
